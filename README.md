# Cosmos

ðŸš§ **Under Construction!** ðŸš§

Cosmos is a **server-based** application built with **Next.js** and **AWS Amplify**. It aims to replicate the core features of Discord, including user authentication, real-time messaging, live voice-chatting, file uploads and multi-channel support. Users can create and join **servers**, where they can communicate within specific channels. This project is my attempt in exploring serverless architecture and modern full-stack development with AWS.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Authentication powered by AWS Cognito.
- **Real-time Messaging**: Instant communication using AWS AppSync.
- **Server Channels**: Create and manage servers for different topics and conversation.
- **User Profiles**: Customize user profiles with basic information and avatars.
- **Serverless Backend**: Backend services powered by AWS, including authentication and database management.
